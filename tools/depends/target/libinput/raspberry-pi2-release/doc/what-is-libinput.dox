@page what_is_libinput What is libinput?

This page describes what libinput is, but more importantly it also describes
what libinput is **not**.

libinput is an input stack to be used by those applications that need full
input device processing by commonly used input devices. That includes mice,
keyboards, touchpads, touchscreens and graphics tablets. libinput handles
device-specific quirks and provides an easy-to-use interface to receive
events from devices.

libinput is designed to handle all input devices available on a system. It
is possible to limit the devices that employ libinput. For example, the use
of xf86-input-libinput depends on xorg.conf snippets for specific
devices. But libinput works best if it handles all input devices as this
allows for cross-device monitoring of events and smarter handling of
features that affect multiple devices.

libinput restricts device-specific features to applicable devices only.
Devices with specific hardware properties may expose extra features, but
these features are not made available on other devices, even where it may be
possible to do so. One example for this are the top software buttons on the
touchpad in the Lenovo T440 and similar devices. While there may be
use-cases for providing top software buttons on other devices, libinput does
not do so.

libinput is **not** a project to support experimental devices. Unless a
device is commonly available off-the-shelf, libinput will not support this
device. libinput can serve as a useful base for getting experimental devices
enabled and reduce the amount of boilerplate required. But such support will
not land in libinput master until the devices are commonly available.

libinput is **not** a box of legos. It does not provide the pieces to
assemble a selection of features. Many features can be disabled through
configuration options, but some features are hardcoded or hardcoded on some
devices. This usually matches the intended use of the device. There are
plenty of use-cases to provide out-of-the-ordinary features, but libinput is
not the place to support these.

libinput is **not** a showcase for features. There are a lot of potential
features that could be provided on input devices. But unless they have
common usage, libinput is not the place to implement them. Every feature
multiplies the maintenance effort, any feature that is provided but unused
is a net drain on the already sparse developer resources libinput has
available.

libinput is boring. It does not intend to break new grounds on how devices
are handled. Instead, it takes best practice and the common use-cases and
provides it in an easy-to-consume package for compositors or other processes
that need those interactions typically expected by users.
