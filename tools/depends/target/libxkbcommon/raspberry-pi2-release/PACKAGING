libxkbcommon consists of two shared libraries, libxkbcommon (the main
library) and libxkbcommon-x11 (an addon library for XCB clients).

The files for libxkbcommon-x11 are:
    libxkbcommon-x11.a libxkbcommon-x11.so* xkbcommon/xkbcommon-x11.h
    xkbcommon-x11.map xkbcommon-x11.pc

libxkbcommon-x11 can be disabled with -Denable-x11=false (see
`meson configure build` for other options/variables).

Dependencies for libxkbcommon:
- C compiler, meson, pkg-config, libc, bash, grep, sed.

- (build) bison (preferred) or byacc>=20141006.
  byacc must be configured with --enable-btyacc.

- (build optional, runtime) xkeyboard-config.
  During build, for automatically detecting the value of
  -Dxkb-config-root instead of guessing (/usr/share/X11/xkb).
  During runtime, not strictly needed, but most users of the library
  would need it.

- (runtime) libX11.
  Contains the dataset for Compose support (/usr/share/X11/locale).
  Please don't depend on it explicitly.

- (build optional) doxygen.
  For generating the HTML documentation.
  To disable, use -Denable-docs=false.

- (build optional) gperf.
  Output included in git and tarball. To regenerate, use
  `./scripts/update-keywords`.

Dependencies for libxkbcommon-x11:
- libxkbcommon.

- libxcb>=1.10 with libxcb-xkb.

Dependencies for libxkbcommon-x11 tests:
- xkbcomp, Xvfb.
  If they are not available, the relevant tests are skipped.

Dependencies for Wayland tests:
- wayland-client>=1.2.0, wayland-scanner, wayland-protocols>=1.0.
  To disable, use -Denable-wayland=false.

Unless libxcb is always available as part of the system, it is preferred
that libxkbcommon and libxkbcommon-x11 be split into separate packages,
such that the main library does not depend on libxcb. This avoids a
transitive dependency of Wayland clients on X libraries.
